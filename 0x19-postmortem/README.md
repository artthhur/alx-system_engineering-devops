**Web Stack Debugging Postmortem: The Epic Saga of the Not-So-Smooth Sailing**

*Hold onto Your Digital Hats, It's Storytime! ðŸš€*

**Issue Summary:**

*Duration:*  
Start Time: October 15, 2023, 02:00 PM UTC  
End Time: October 15, 2023, 04:30 PM UTC

*Impact:*  
Imagine a galactic game of hide-and-seek, but the seekers (that's us) lost 60% of the players (you, our dear users). Messages went on a mysterious vacation, leaving us all in the cosmic dark.

*Root Cause:*  
Turns out, our routing algorithm decided to play hooky and led our messages astray. Who knew algorithms had a rebellious side?

**Timeline:**

*Detection Time:*  
October 15, 2023, 02:15 PM UTC

*Detection Method:*  
Our monitoring system threw a fit, yelling at us about a sudden drop in messages. We're not saying it's dramatic, but it might have sent an alert in all caps.

*Actions Taken:*  
- Dived into the logs like treasure hunters seeking a hidden chest.
- Suspected the database was on a lunch break, so we joined in.
- Thought we had a spy situation and briefly considered launching a counterintelligence mission.
- Summoned the Hyperspace Routing Team when our messaging ship went off course.

*Misleading Paths:*  
- Fell into the database optimization rabbit hole. Turns out, the database was napping, not overloaded.
- Tried to outsmart a potential spy, but it was just our overactive imagination.

*Escalation:*  
Hyperspace Routing Team received a distress signal, complete with flashing lights and a siren.

*Resolution:*  
After an intense counseling session with the routing algorithm, we fixed its rebellious attitude. Messages returned, and peace was restored in the digital realm.

**Root Cause and Resolution:**

*Root Cause:*  
Our routing algorithm decided to pull a Houdini and misplaced our messages. We blame cosmic mischief.

*Resolution:*  
Gave the algorithm a stern talking-to, adjusted its settings, and implemented automated tests to keep it in check. No more cosmic escapades, we hope.

**Corrective and Preventative Measures:**

*Improvements:*  
- Scheduled regular checks for critical settings. We're now the helicopter parents of configurations.
- Amped up monitoring, because we're not letting our algorithms out of sight.

*Specific Tasks:*  
1. Checked if our routing algorithms were still playing by the rules.
2. Automated tests to prevent algorithmic mischief.
3. Gave our monitoring tools superhero capes for real-time insights.
4. Created an incident escalation guide â€“ because even algorithms need a babysitter.

**Conclusion:**

Picture this: The epic tale of the Great Galactic Glitch, filled with twists, turns, and a routing algorithm that needed a timeout. We're back on track, messages are flowing, and our algorithms are behaving (for now). Join us on the next chapter of our cosmic adventure â€“ it's bound to be a page-turner! ðŸ“šâœ¨
